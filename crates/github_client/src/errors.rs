//! Error types for GitHub client operations.
//!
//! This module defines the error types that can occur when interacting with the GitHub API
//! through the github_client crate. It provides comprehensive error context for debugging
//! and error handling in applications using this client.

/// Errors that can occur during GitHub client operations.
///
/// This enum represents all possible error conditions when working with the GitHub API,
/// including authentication failures, API errors, rate limiting, and data processing issues.
/// Each variant provides specific context about what went wrong and relevant details
/// for debugging and error handling.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use github_client::Error;
///
/// // Handle different error types
/// match github_client.create_repository(&payload).await {
///     Ok(repo) => println!("Repository created: {}", repo.name()),
///     Err(Error::AuthError(msg)) => eprintln!("Authentication failed: {}", msg),
///     Err(Error::RateLimitExceeded) => eprintln!("Rate limit exceeded, retry later"),
///     Err(err) => eprintln!("Other error: {}", err),
/// }
/// ```
