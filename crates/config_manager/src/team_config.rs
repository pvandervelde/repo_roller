//! Team-specific configuration overrides.
//!
//! TeamConfig allows teams within an organization to customize repository settings
//! for their specific needs, overriding global defaults where permitted.
//!
//! # Configuration Hierarchy
//!
//! In the four-level hierarchy:
//! - Template (highest precedence)
//! - **Team** ‚Üê This level
//! - Repository Type
//! - Global (lowest precedence)
//!
//! Team configurations:
//! - Override global defaults (when `override_allowed = true`)
//! - Are themselves overridden by templates
//! - Use simple TOML format (values auto-wrap with `override_allowed = true`)
//! - Support additive merging for collections (webhooks, apps, environments)
//!
//! # TOML Format
//!
//! Team configurations use simple value format:
//!
//! ```toml
//! # teams/backend-team/config.toml
//!
//! [repository]
//! discussions = false  # Override global default
//! projects = true
//!
//! [pull_requests]
//! required_approving_review_count = 2
//! require_code_owner_reviews = true
//!
//! [[webhooks]]
//! url = "https://backend-team.example.com/webhook"
//! content_type = "json"
//! events = ["push", "pull_request"]
//!
//! [[github_apps]]
//! app_id = 11111
//! permissions = { contents = "read", issues = "write" }
//! ```
//!
