# Org-level outbound webhook notification configuration.
#
# Defines webhook endpoints that receive notifications when RepoRoller creates
# repositories. These endpoints are active for all repository creations in the
# organization unless overridden at the team or template level.
#
# Format: notifications.toml
# Location: .reporoller/global/notifications.toml in the metadata repository
#
# Note: This file is part of the integration test metadata. Endpoints are set to
# active = false to prevent test runs from attempting real webhook deliveries.
