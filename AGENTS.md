# Agent Development Guidelines

This document provides guidelines and conventions for AI agents working on this codebase.

## Production Software Standards

**This is production-grade software.** All code must meet production quality standards:

- **Complete Implementation**: No TODOs, placeholders, or "demonstration" code. Every feature must be fully implemented.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: All error paths must be handled properly, with clear error messages and proper error propagation.
- **Full Test Coverage**: All functionality must have comprehensive tests covering happy paths, error cases, and edge conditions.
- **Production-Ready Documentation**: All public APIs must have complete rustdoc with examples, error conditions, and behavioral specifications.
- **Security First**: All security-sensitive operations must be implemented with production-grade security measures.
- **Performance Conscious**: Code must be optimized for production workloads, not just correctness.
- **Observability**: All operations must have appropriate logging, metrics, and tracing for production debugging.

When implementing features:

- Write production code from the start - no prototypes or demos
- Think about failure scenarios and edge cases
- Consider operational concerns (monitoring, debugging, maintenance)
- Implement complete functionality, not partial demonstrations

## Pre-Implementation Checklist

Before implementing features, verify:

1. **Read Specifications**: Check `docs/spec/` for relevant documentation
2. Read `docs/constraints.md` (tripwires + hard rules)
3. Read `docs/catalog.md` (what already exists to reuse)
4. Read relevant standards in `docs/standards/` (language/domain specific)
5. **Search Existing Code**: Use semantic_search to find similar implementations
6. **Check Module Structure**: Determine if code belongs in existing module or needs new one
7. **Security Review**: Identify sensitive data (tokens, secrets) requiring special handling
8. **Plan Tests**: Identify test scenarios before writing implementation

## Summary

Following these conventions ensures:

- **Consistency**: Codebase looks like one person wrote it
- **Maintainability**: Easy to find and understand code
- **Quality**: High test coverage and clear documentation
- **Security**: Sensitive data handled properly
- **Performance**: Conscious resource management

When in doubt, look at existing code in the repository as examples of these patterns in practice.


## Task Management

This project uses Beads (bd) for AI-friendly task tracking.

### Before starting work

1. Check what's ready: `bd ready --json`
2. Pick a task: `bd show bd-abc --json`
3. Start work: `bd update bd-abc working`

### When creating new tasks

1. Create issue: `bd create "Task description" -p 1 -t feature`
2. Add dependencies: `bd update bd-xyz --blocks bd-abc`
3. The task will auto-appear in `bd ready` when blockers are done

### When finishing work

1. Commit with issue ID: `git commit -m "Fix auth bug (bd-abc)"`
2. Close issue: `bd close bd-abc --reason "Completed"`
3. Sync: `bd sync` (usually automatic)

### Integration with ADRs

- Link ADRs in task descriptions: "See ADR-0005 for context"
- Create tasks for implementing ADR decisions
- Reference task IDs in ADR implementation notes

### Quick reference

``bash
bd ready              # Show tasks ready to work on
bd create "desc" -p 1 # Create new task (priority 1-5)
bd show bd-xyz        # Show task details
bd update bd-xyz working  # Mark task in progress
bd close bd-xyz       # Close completed task
bd search "keyword"   # Search tasks
bd doctor             # Check for orphaned work
``
