## Distributed Tracing

### Trace Context Propagation

**Request Correlation**: Unique trace IDs for end-to-end request tracking across all system components and external service calls.

**Span Organization**: Hierarchical spans for major operation phases (authentication, configuration resolution, template processing, repository creation).

**Context Enrichment**: Spans include relevant business context (organization, user, template type) while protecting sensitive information.

### Key Trace Points

**Repository Creation Flow**:

- Request validation and parsing
- User authentication and authorization
- Configuration hierarchy resolution
- Template content retrieval and processing
- GitHub repository creation and configuration
- Response generation and delivery

**Configuration Resolution**:

- Metadata repository discovery
- Configuration file loading from multiple sources
- Hierarchical merge operations and override validation
- Cache operations (hits, misses, updates)

**Template Processing**:

- Template content retrieval and validation
- Variable substitution and rendering
- Security validation and path checking
- File generation and repository content preparation

### External Service Traces

**GitHub API Interactions**: Trace all GitHub API calls with response codes, timing, and rate limit status.

**Azure Service Calls**: Trace Key Vault access, storage operations, and other Azure service interactions.

**Configuration Repository Access**: Trace metadata repository content retrieval and caching operations.

## Monitoring and Alerting
