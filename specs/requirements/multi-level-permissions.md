# Multi-Level Permissions System Requirements

## Overview

The multi-level permissions system provides a comprehensive framework for managing repository access permissions across different organizational levels. This system enables organizations to define baseline permissions, templates to specify access requirements, and users to request additional permissions within policy boundaries. The system ensures consistent security governance while providing flexibility for different repository types and team structures.

## Permission Hierarchy

The system implements a four-level permission hierarchy with the following precedence (most restrictive to most permissive):

1. **Organization Baseline Permissions** - Minimum required permissions for all repositories
2. **Repository Type Permissions** - Type-specific permission requirements and restrictions
3. **Template-Defined Permissions** - Template-specified access patterns and requirements
4. **User-Requested Permissions** - Additional permissions requested during repository creation
