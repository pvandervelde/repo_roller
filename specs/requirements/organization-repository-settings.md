# Organization-Specific Repository Settings Requirements

## Overview

Organization-specific repository settings provide a robust mechanism for loading and applying organization-wide repository creation rules. This system ensures consistency across all repositories within an organization while allowing controlled flexibility for teams and templates to override specific settings when appropriate.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Configuration Hierarchy System

The system SHALL implement a four-level configuration hierarchy with the following precedence (highest to lowest):

1. **Template Configuration** - Template-specific settings and requirements
2. **Team Configuration** - Team-specific overrides and policies
3. **Repository Type Configuration** - Type-specific settings based on repository purpose
4. **Global Defaults** - Organization-wide baseline settings

### FR-2: Repository Type Management

#### FR-2.1: Repository Type Definition

- Organizations SHALL be able to define custom repository types through configuration
- Repository types SHALL represent the purpose and content of repositories (e.g., "actions", "library", "service", "team", "personal", "documentation")
- Repository type names SHALL be configurable by the organization
- Repository types SHALL be implemented as GitHub custom properties
- Repository type assignment SHALL be optional - repositories may exist without a type

#### FR-2.2: Type-Specific Configuration

- Each repository type SHALL support type-specific configuration settings
- Type-specific settings SHALL override global defaults but be overridden by team and template settings
- Type configurations SHALL be stored in `types/{type-name}/config.toml`
- The system SHALL validate type-specific settings against global override policies

#### FR-2.3: Type-Based Settings Examples

- Documentation repositories SHALL default to disabled wiki (documentation is in the repository itself)
- Action repositories SHALL have specific branch protection rules for marketplace compliance
- Library repositories SHALL have enhanced security settings and required status checks
- Service repositories SHALL have deployment environment configurations
- Personal repositories SHALL have relaxed collaboration requirements

### FR-3: Metadata Repository Management

#### FR-3.1: Repository Discovery

- The system SHALL support metadata repository discovery through multiple methods:
  - Configuration-based: Repository name specified in app configuration
  - Topic-based: Repository tagged with `template-metadata` topic
- The system SHALL require metadata repository to be in the same organization as target repositories
- The system SHALL validate metadata repository access and structure during initialization

#### FR-3.2: Repository Structure

- Metadata repositories SHALL follow a standardized directory structure:
  - `global/` directory for organization-wide defaults
  - `teams/{team-name}/` directories for team-specific configurations
  - `schemas/` directory for validation schemas
- The system SHALL validate repository structure and required files during loading

### FR-4: Global Organization Defaults

#### FR-4.1: Default Settings Management

- Team resources SHALL be additive to global resources (not replacement)
- Team-specific environments and custom properties SHALL be supported
- The system SHALL merge team resources with global defaults appropriately

### FR-6: Template-Specific Configuration

#### FR-6.1: Template Requirements

- Templates SHALL be able to specify template-specific repository settings

#### FR-6.3: Template Repository Type Specification

- Templates SHALL be able to specify the repository type for repositories created from the template
- Templates SHALL define repository type policy as either "fixed" or "preferable"
- Templates with "fixed" repository type policy SHALL prevent user override during repository creation
- Templates with "preferable" repository type policy SHALL allow user override while providing a default
- Templates without repository type specification SHALL allow any user-specified type
- The system SHALL validate user repository type overrides against template policies

- Error handling provides clear guidance for repository setup issues

### AC-3: Override Policy System

- Override permissions are correctly enforced during configuration merging
- Unauthorized override attempts are detected and rejected
- Security-critical settings cannot be overridden regardless of user privileges
- Override validation provides clear error messages and resolution guidance

- Cache invalidation correctly handles metadata repository changes
- Concurrent access performs within acceptable limits
- Cache consistency is maintained across multiple application instances

## Behavioral Assertions

1. Configuration hierarchy must be enforced consistently - template settings always override team settings, which override global defaults
2. Override policies must be respected regardless of user privileges or configuration source
3. Security-critical settings marked as non-overridable must never be modified by teams or templates
4. Configuration loading must be atomic - either all configurations load successfully or the operation fails completely
5. Cache invalidation must be immediate when metadata repository changes are detected
6. Configuration merging must be deterministic - same inputs always produce same outputs
7. Team configurations must only apply to repositories created for that specific team
8. Template configurations must be validated against organization policies during template registration
9. Concurrent repository creation must not interfere with configuration loading or caching
10. Configuration validation must catch all schema violations and business rule violations before repository creation begins
11. Override audit trails must be maintained for all configuration merge operations
12. Metadata repository access must respect GitHub App permission boundaries
