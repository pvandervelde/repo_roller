# Problem Statement

## The Challenge

Developers and teams often need to create new GitHub repositories based on standardized templates. The current manual process is:

- **Time-consuming**: Each repository requires multiple manual steps
- **Error-prone**: Human mistakes in copying, configuration, and setup
- **Inconsistent**: Different developers may apply standards differently
- **Repetitive**: The same setup tasks are performed repeatedly

## Manual Process Pain Points

When creating a new repository manually, developers must:

1. **Template Management**
   - Find and access the correct template repository
   - Manually copy or fork template content
   - Remember which files need customization

2. **Content Customization**
   - Replace placeholder values throughout multiple files
   - Update project names, descriptions, and metadata
   - Modify configuration files and documentation

3. **Repository Configuration**
   - Set appropriate repository settings and permissions
   - Configure branch protection rules
   - Create standard issue labels and templates

4. **Team Setup**
   - Assign correct team and user permissions
   - Configure notification settings
   - Set up project-specific workflows

## Business Impact

These manual processes result in:

- **Reduced Developer Productivity**: Time spent on setup instead of feature development
- **Compliance Risks**: Inconsistent application of organizational standards
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Difficulty updating standards across existing repositories
- **Onboarding Friction**: New team members struggle with non-standard repository layouts

## Target Environment

RepoRoller addresses these challenges within:

- **GitHub-centric workflows** where repositories are the primary development unit
- **Organizations with standardized templates** for different project types (libraries, services, actions)
- **Teams requiring consistent repository setup** across multiple projects
- **Development environments** needing both CLI tooling and web interfaces

## Success Criteria

A successful solution will:

- **Eliminate manual repository setup tasks** through full automation
- **Ensure consistent standards application** across all new repositories
- **Reduce repository creation time** from hours to minutes
- **Enable template evolution** without retrofitting existing repositories
- **Support multiple interaction methods** (CLI, web, API, MCP) for different use cases

## Constraints and Context

The solution must operate within:

- **GitHub API limitations** including rate limits and permission requirements
- **Organizational security policies** for credential management and access control
- **Existing development workflows** without requiring significant process changes
- **Multiple deployment environments** from local development to cloud functions

This problem statement establishes the foundation for RepoRoller's design, ensuring the solution directly addresses real developer pain points while working within existing organizational constraints.
