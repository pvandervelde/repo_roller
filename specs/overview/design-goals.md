## Design Decisions

### Technology Choices

#### Backend Language: Rust

**Decision**: Use Rust for all backend components

**Rationale**:

- **Performance**: Near-native performance for template processing and API operations
- **Safety**: Memory safety and robust error handling reduce runtime failures
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Single binary deployment to multiple environments
- **Ecosystem**: Strong ecosystem for web services, CLI tools, and async programming

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **Go**: Similar performance benefits but less type safety
- **Python/Node.js**: Faster development but potential performance and safety concerns
- **C#**: Good Azure integration but larger runtime footprint

#### Frontend Framework: SvelteKit

**Decision**: Use SvelteKit for web interface

**Rationale**:

- **Performance**: Small bundle size and fast runtime performance
- **Developer Experience**: Intuitive component model and excellent tooling
- **SSR Support**: Server-side rendering for better SEO and initial load performance
- **Ecosystem**: Good integration with modern web tooling and deployment platforms

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **React**: Larger ecosystem but more complex and larger bundle size
- **Vue.js**: Good developer experience but smaller ecosystem
- **Angular**: Comprehensive framework but heavyweight for this use case

#### Deployment Platform: Azure Functions

**Decision**: Deploy backend as Azure Functions with additional CLI support

**Rationale**:

- **Serverless Benefits**: Automatic scaling and pay-per-use pricing model
- **Azure Integration**: Native integration with Azure Key Vault, Monitor, and other services
- **Development Flexibility**: Support for both serverless and traditional deployment models
- **Cost Efficiency**: Optimal for variable workload patterns

- **Liquid**: Good templating features but less familiar to developers

### Architectural Decisions

#### Modular Crate Structure

**Decision**: Organize backend as multiple focused Rust crates

**Benefits**:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between different system components
- **Testability**: Independent testing of individual components
- **Reusability**: Components can be used independently in different contexts

- **Future-Proofing**: Additional interfaces can be added without core changes

### Security Decisions

#### GitHub App Authentication

**Benefits**:

- **Fine-Grained Permissions**: Minimal required permissions for each operation
- **Automatic Rotation**: Short-lived tokens with automatic refresh
- **Organization Control**: Organizations control app installation and permissions
- **Audit Trail**: Clear audit trail of all API operations

#### Azure Key Vault Integration

**Decision**: Store all secrets in Azure Key Vault with runtime retrieval
