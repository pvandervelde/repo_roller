# Solution Overview

## Core Concept

RepoRoller is an automated GitHub repository creation and configuration system that transforms template repositories into fully configured, production-ready projects. It eliminates manual setup tasks by providing a standardized, repeatable process for repository creation.

## High-Level Approach

RepoRoller operates as a **GitHub App** to interact with the GitHub API, providing multiple interfaces for users to request repository creation based on predefined templates.

### The RepoRoller Workflow

1. **Request Processing**
   - User submits repository creation request via CLI, Web UI, REST API, or MCP
   - Request specifies repository name, template type, owner, and template variables

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Validate user credentials and permissions
   - Ensure user has rights to create repositories in target organization

3. **Template Selection & Processing**
   - Identify and access the appropriate template repository
   - Clone template content for processing
   - Perform variable substitution using templating engine

4. **Repository Creation**
   - Create new repository on GitHub with processed content
   - Push customized files as initial commit to main branch

5. **Configuration Application**
   - Apply repository settings (description, topics, features)
   - Configure branch protection rules and security settings
   - Create standard issue labels and templates
   - Set team and user permissions

6. **Completion & Reporting**
   - Verify successful setup completion
   - Report results back to user with repository URL and summary

## Key Capabilities

### Template Management

- **Flexible Templates**: Support for multiple repository types (libraries, services, GitHub Actions)
- **Variable Substitution**: Dynamic replacement of placeholders with actual values
- **Content Processing**: Handle files, directories, and repository metadata
- **Template Evolution**: Easy updates to templates without affecting existing repositories

### Multi-Interface Support

- **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for developers and automation scripts
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly web application for interactive repository creation
- **REST API**: Programmatic access for integration with other tools
- **MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol integration for AI/LLM workflows

### Repository Configuration

- **Automated Settings**: Branch protection, merge policies, security features
- **Standard Labels**: Consistent issue and PR labeling across repositories
- **Team Permissions**: Automatic assignment of appropriate access levels
- **Templates & Workflows**: Standard issue templates and GitHub Actions

## Technology Stack

### Backend (Rust)

- **Performance**: Fast execution for template processing and API interactions
- **Safety**: Memory safety and robust error handling
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Single binary deployable as CLI, web service, or Azure Function

### Frontend (SvelteKit)

- **User Experience**: Intuitive interface for repository creation
- **Integration**: Seamless connection to backend REST API
- **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop and mobile devices

### Infrastructure (Azure)

- **Scalability**: Azure Functions for serverless execution
- **Security**: Azure Key Vault for credential management
- **Observability**: Azure Monitor for logging and metrics

## Deployment Models

### Development & Testing

- **Local CLI**: Direct execution for development and testing
- **Local API Server**: Development server for frontend integration

### Production

- **Azure Functions**: Serverless backend hosting
- **Static Web Hosting**: Frontend deployment to Azure Static Web Apps or CDN
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for reproducible deployments

## Integration Points

### GitHub API

- **Repository Management**: Creation, configuration, and content management
- **Authentication**: OAuth flows and GitHub App token management
- **Permissions**: Team and user access control

### External Services

- **Template Repositories**: Source templates from GitHub repositories
- **Configuration Storage**: External configuration for template definitions
- **Monitoring Services**: Integration with observability platforms

## Benefits

### For Developers

- **Instant Setup**: Repository ready for development in minutes
- **Consistency**: Identical setup across all projects
- **Focus on Code**: More time for feature development, less on configuration

### For Organizations

- **Standards Compliance**: Automatic application of organizational policies
- **Reduced Maintenance**: Centralized template management
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of repository creation and configuration

### For Teams

- **Collaboration**: Standardized repository structure aids team collaboration
- **Onboarding**: New team members work with familiar repository layouts
- **Scaling**: Easy creation of new projects as teams grow
