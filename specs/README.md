# RepoRoller Specification

Welcome to the RepoRoller specification documentation. This living document serves as the comprehensive guide for understanding, implementing, and maintaining the RepoRoller system.

## What is RepoRoller?

RepoRoller is a GitHub repository automation tool that standardizes the creation and initial setup of new repositories based on predefined templates. It eliminates the manual, error-prone process of copying templates, replacing placeholders, and configuring repository settings.

## Contributing to the Specification

This specification is a living document that evolves with the project. When making changes:

1. **Keep it current**: Update specs to reflect actual implementation
2. **Be specific**: Provide concrete details rather than vague descriptions
3. **Cross-reference**: Link related sections and maintain consistency
4. **Consider impact**: Think about how changes affect other components
5. **Document decisions**: Explain the reasoning behind design choices
