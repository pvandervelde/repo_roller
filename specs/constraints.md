# Implementation Constraints

This document defines the architectural rules, constraints, and policies that must be enforced throughout the RepoRoller implementation. These constraints ensure system reliability, maintainability, security, and performance.

## Type System Constraints

### Branded Types Requirement

**Constraint**: All domain primitives must use branded types (newtype pattern) to prevent type confusion.

**Rationale**: Prevents accidental mixing of conceptually different values that have the same underlying type.

**Enforcement**:

- Repository names, organization names, template types must be distinct types
- User IDs, session IDs, and other identifiers must be strongly typed
- No `String` or `u64` parameters in public domain interfaces

**Examples of Required Branded Types**:

- `RepositoryName`, `OrganizationName`, `TemplateType`
- `UserId`, `SessionId`, `InstallationId`
- `GitHubToken`, `ConfigurationKey`

### Result Type Requirement

**Constraint**: All fallible operations must use `Result<T, E>` pattern rather than exceptions.

**Rationale**: Makes error handling explicit and prevents unexpected panics.

**Enforcement**:

- No `panic!`, `unwrap()`, or `expect()` in production code paths
- All public functions returning fallible results must use `Result<T, E>`
- Custom error types must implement appropriate traits (`Error`, `Display`, `Debug`)

### No Any/Dynamic Types

**Constraint**: No use of `Any` trait or dynamic typing in domain code.

**Rationale**: Maintains type safety and compile-time verification.

**Enforcement**:

- All template variables must be strongly typed through `serde_json::Value`
- Configuration values must have known types at compile time
- Interface boundaries must use concrete types

## Module Boundary Constraints

### Dependency Direction Rules

**Constraint**: Dependency flow must follow hexagonal architecture principles.

**Core Dependencies**:

- Core domain depends only on standard library and essential crates (`serde`, `chrono`, `uuid`)
- Core domain never imports infrastructure or interface modules
- Service layer can depend on core domain and define abstract ports
- Infrastructure layer implements ports but never imports other infrastructure

**Interface Dependencies**:

- Interface layer depends on core domain through service layer
- Multiple interface implementations (CLI, API, MCP) can coexist
- Interface layer handles protocol-specific concerns only

### Port/Adapter Pattern Enforcement

**Constraint**: All external system interactions must go through defined ports.

**Port Requirements**:

- All external dependencies represented as traits (ports)
- Traits define only abstract behavior, no implementation details
- Implementation (adapters) lives in infrastructure layer

**Examples of Required Ports**:

- `GitHubRepository` trait for all GitHub API operations
- `ConfigurationStorage` trait for configuration persistence
- `AuditLogger` trait for audit trail recording
- `TemplateRenderer` trait for template processing

### Import Restrictions

**Constraint**: Strict import rules prevent architectural violations.

**Domain Layer Imports**:

- May import: `std`, `serde`, `chrono`, `uuid`, `thiserror`
- May not import: HTTP clients, database drivers, external APIs

**Service Layer Imports**:

- May import: Domain layer, async runtime (`tokio`), trait definitions
- May not import: Specific infrastructure implementations

**Infrastructure Layer Imports**:

- May import: Service layer traits, external service clients
- May not import: Other infrastructure implementations

## Error Handling Constraints

### Error Type Hierarchy

**Constraint**: Errors must follow established hierarchy with proper context preservation.

**Hierarchy Structure**:

- Top-level: `RepoRollerError` enum with variant for each domain
- Domain-specific: `ValidationError`, `ProcessingError`, `ConfigurationError`, `SystemError`
- Context preservation: All errors include relevant context for debugging
- Conversion: Automatic conversion through `From` trait implementations

### Error Context Requirements

**Constraint**: All errors must include sufficient context for debugging and user guidance.

**Required Context**:

- Operation being performed when error occurred
- Input values that caused the error (sanitized)
- Suggestions for resolution where applicable
- Trace information for system errors

### No Error Swallowing

**Constraint**: Errors must never be silently ignored or converted to default values.

**Enforcement**:

- All `Result` values must be explicitly handled
- Error conversion must preserve original error information
- Logging of errors at appropriate levels before handling

## Asynchronous Programming Constraints

### Async Boundary Definition

**Constraint**: Clear separation between sync and async code with explicit boundaries.

**Async Operations**:

- I/O operations: GitHub API calls, file system access, network requests
- Resource acquisition: Authentication token retrieval, configuration loading
- Coordination: Cross-service communication, cache operations

**Sync Operations**:

- Pure computation: Template rendering, configuration merging
- Domain logic: Business rule validation, state transitions
- Data transformation: Serialization, format conversion

### Timeout Requirements

**Constraint**: All async operations must have explicit timeouts.

**Timeout Categories**:

- Quick operations (< 5 seconds): Token validation, cache lookups
- Standard operations (< 30 seconds): GitHub API calls, configuration loading
- Long operations (< 2 minutes): Template processing, repository creation

**Implementation**:

- Timeout values configurable through application configuration
- Graceful timeout handling with appropriate error messages
- Monitoring and alerting on timeout frequencies

## Configuration Constraints

### Hierarchical Configuration Rules

**Constraint**: Configuration resolution must follow strict precedence and override rules.

**Precedence Order** (lowest to highest):

1. Encoded defaults (cannot be overridden)
2. Application configuration (global settings)
3. Organization configuration (per-organization)
4. Team configuration (per-team within organization)
5. Template configuration (highest precedence)

**Override Policy Enforcement**:

- Security-critical settings cannot be overridden regardless of level
- Override permissions explicitly defined in configuration schema
- Violations result in configuration resolution failure

### Configuration Validation

**Constraint**: All configuration must be validated before use.

**Validation Requirements**:

- Schema validation: Structure and type correctness
- Business rule validation: Cross-field constraints and policies
- Security validation: No dangerous or prohibited values
- Completeness validation: All required fields present

### Runtime Configuration Loading

**Constraint**: Configuration must support runtime loading with appropriate fallbacks.

**Loading Strategy**:

- Encoded defaults always available (compiled into binary)
- File-based configuration with graceful degradation if unavailable
- Environment variable overrides for deployment-specific settings
- Cache with TTL and invalidation for performance

### Single Organization Scope

**Constraint**: Each RepoRoller instance serves exactly one GitHub organization.

**Organizational Boundaries**:

- GitHub App installation scoped to single organization
- Configuration system assumes single organization context
- User authentication and authorization within organization scope only
- No cross-organization data leakage or configuration mixing
- Organization-specific deployment and monitoring

## Security Constraints

### Input Validation Requirements

**Constraint**: All external input must be validated before processing.

**Validation Scope**:

- User-provided data: Repository names, template variables, configuration values
- External API responses: GitHub API data, webhook payloads
- File content: Template files, configuration files, user uploads

**Validation Rules**:

- Format validation: Data type, length, character set constraints
- Business rule validation: Domain-specific constraints and policies
- Security validation: No injection attacks, path traversal prevention
- Sanitization: Remove or escape dangerous content

### Authentication Requirements

**Constraint**: All operations must occur within authenticated context.

**Authentication Context**:

- User identity: GitHub user information and organization memberships
- Permission scope: What operations user is authorized to perform
- Token lifecycle: Proper token validation and refresh handling
- Session management: Secure session handling for web interfaces

### Audit Trail Requirements

**Constraint**: All significant operations must be logged for audit purposes.

**Audit Coverage**:

- Authentication events: Login attempts, token validation, permission checks
- Repository operations: Creation requests, configuration applied, errors encountered
- Configuration changes: What changed, who changed it, when it changed
- Security events: Failed authentication, permission violations, suspicious activity

## Performance Constraints

### Response Time Requirements

**Constraint**: Operations must complete within acceptable time boundaries.

**Performance Targets**:

- Authentication: < 200ms for token validation
- Configuration resolution: < 500ms for cached configurations
- Template processing: < 30 seconds for standard templates
- Repository creation: < 2 minutes end-to-end

### Concurrency Requirements

**Constraint**: System must handle concurrent operations safely and efficiently.

**Concurrency Safety**:

- No shared mutable state without proper synchronization
- Thread-safe caching mechanisms with consistent reads
- Database/API operations must handle concurrent access
- Configuration loading must support multiple simultaneous requests

### Resource Usage Limits

**Constraint**: Operations must respect resource consumption limits.

**Resource Limits**:

- Memory usage: Template processing < 100MB per operation
- File processing: Template files < 50MB total size
- API rate limits: Respect GitHub API rate limits with intelligent backoff
- Cache size: Configuration cache with LRU eviction and size limits

## Testing Constraints

### Test Coverage Requirements

**Constraint**: Comprehensive test coverage across all architectural layers.

**Coverage Requirements**:

- Unit tests: 90%+ coverage of domain logic
- Integration tests: All port implementations tested against real services
- Contract tests: Port interface contracts verified
- End-to-end tests: Complete workflows from interface to external services

### Test Isolation Requirements

**Constraint**: Tests must be isolated and repeatable.

**Isolation Rules**:

- No shared state between test cases
- Mock all external dependencies in unit tests
- Integration tests use dedicated test environments
- Test data cleanup after test execution

### Test Double Strategy

**Constraint**: Consistent approach to test doubles across the system.

**Test Double Types**:

- Mocks: For behavior verification of port interactions
- Stubs: For providing predetermined responses from dependencies
- Fakes: For lightweight implementations during testing
- Test builders: For creating test data with sensible defaults

## Documentation Constraints

**Constraint**: Significant architectural decisions must be documented.

**Documentation Requirements**:

- Decision context and alternatives considered
- Rationale for chosen approach
- Expected consequences and trade-offs
- Success criteria and monitoring approach

## Deployment Constraints

### Environment Parity

**Constraint**: Code must work consistently across all deployment environments.

**Environment Requirements**:

- No hardcoded environment-specific values
- Configuration externalized for different environments
- Feature flags for environment-specific behavior
- Consistent behavior regardless of deployment method

### Observability Requirements

**Constraint**: System must provide comprehensive observability.

**Observability Coverage**:

- Structured logging with consistent fields
- Metrics for business operations and system health
- Distributed tracing for request flow
- Health check endpoints for monitoring systems

These constraints provide the framework within which all RepoRoller components must be implemented. They ensure architectural consistency, system reliability, and maintainability while supporting the complex requirements of the repository automation domain.
